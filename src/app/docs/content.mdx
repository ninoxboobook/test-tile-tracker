## Using Test Tile Tracker {#using-test-tile-tracker}

Test Tile Tracker organises your work through four interconnected components:

1. Clay bodies: Create entries for each clay type you use
2. Decorations: Document glazes, slips, oxides, and other surface treatments
3. Test tiles: Record experiments that combine clay bodies with decorations
4. Collections: Group related test tiles for easy reference

Linking these components together allows you to quickly filter your test tiles by clay body, decoration, 
firing temperature, atmosphere, or multiple attributes. As your library grows, you'll be able to track 
patterns and results across different combinations.

### Adding a clay body {#clay-bodies}
Clay bodies are the foundation of your ceramic work, and in Test Tile Tracker, they're the starting point for documenting your experiments. 
Every test tile you create will be linked to a clay body, allowing you to track how different clays perform with various decorations and firing conditions.

To create a clay body entry:
1. From the Clay Body page, click on the 'Add new clay body' button in the top right
2. Enter required information:
   - Name
   - Type (stoneware, porcelain, etc.)
3. Add optional details:
   - Manufacturer
   - Cone range
   - Firing temperatures
   - Physical properties
   - Colour characteristics
   - Technical measurements
   - Notes and images

Once you have created a clay body and begin using it in test tiles, any tile using it will appear in the clay body entry.

### Adding a decoration {#decorations}
Decorations in Test Tile Tracker can be anything you apply to your clay â€“ from commercial glazes to hand-mixed slips. 
When you create test tiles, you'll be able to select from your decoration library and layer them in specific orders. 
This structured approach helps you track which combinations work best and under what conditions.

To record a decoration:
1. From the Decoration page, click on the 'Add new decoration' button in the top right
2. Add required information:
   - Name
   - Type (glaze, underglaze, slip, etc.)
3. Specify details:
   - Source (commercial, studio, etc.)
   - Manufacturer (if applicable)
   - Cone range
   - Firing atmosphere options
   - Colour and surface characteristics
   - Recipe or Glazy link (if applicable)
   - Notes and images

Once you have created a decoration and begin using it in test tiles, any tile using it will appear in the decoration entry.

### Adding a test tile {#test-tiles}
Test tiles are where your library comes to life. Each test tile combines a clay body from your clay library with one or more 
decorations from your decoration library. This interconnected approach means you can easily track how specific decorations 
perform on different clay bodies, or how a particular clay body accepts various decorations.

To add a test tile:
1. From the Test Tiles page, click on the 'Add new test tile' button in the top right
2. Enter basic information:
   - Name
   - Stamp identifier (optional)
   - Clay body
   - Cone
   - Atmosphere
3. Add decoration layers:
   - Select a decoration or decorations from the 'Layer 1' dropdown menu
   - If layering decorations, click 'Add layer' and repeat the decoration selection process
4. Complete the record:
   - Add to collections (optional)
   - Include notes
   - Upload images

Understanding test tile relationships:
- Each test tile is linked to one clay body
- Test tiles can include multiple decoration layers
- Decoration layers allow you to see what order you applied the decorations in
- All firing conditions are recorded
- Results can be filtered by clay body, decoration, cone, atmosphere

### Adding a collection {#collections}
Collections help you group related test tiles in ways that make sense for your work. You might create collections based on 
clay body, decoration type, firing conditions, or project goals. Because test tiles maintain their links to clay bodies and 
decorations, you can easily see patterns within collections.

To create a collection:
1. From the Collections page, click on the 'Add new collection' button in the top right
   - Name your collection
   - Add a description
2. Add test tiles:
   - Select tiles to include
3. Organise and maintain:
   - Add or remove tiles
   - Update descriptions
   - View all related tests

### Advanced use{#advanced}
All of the steps outlined above can be done from the 'Add test tile' page.

When selecting a clay body, there is an option to 'Add new clay body'. This will open a window where you can add a new clay body. 
Clicking 'Create new clay body' will close the window, save the clay body to your library, and then select it for your test tile.

When adding decoration layers, there is an option to 'Add new decoration'. This will open a window where you can add a new decoration. 
Clicking 'Create new decoration' will close the window, save the clay body to your library, and then add it to the current active decoration layer.

Lastly, you can add your new test tile to any existing collection or collections available in your library.

## Getting the most out of your library {#getting-the-most-out-of-your-library}
As your library grows, the relationships between clay bodies, decorations, and test tiles become increasingly valuable. 
Test Tile Tracker's filtering and search capabilities help you explore these connections.

### Sort, filter and search {#sort-filter-search}
The interconnected nature of your library allows for powerful filtering:
- Find all test tiles using a specific clay body
- See how decorations change based on the clay body they're paired with
- Compare results across different firing conditions
- Track successful combinations through related entries

To find specific items or patterns:
1. Use the search bar for keywords
2. Apply filters for:
   - Clay types
   - Cone ranges
   - Atmospheres
   - Colours
   - Sources
3. Sort results by any column in table view by clicking on the column heading

### Table and grid view {#table-grid-view}
Your library of test tiles, clay bodies and decorations can be viewed as a table or in a grid. Table view maximises 
the amount of text detail visible, whereas grid view shows larger images.

You can search and filter in both table and grid view.

To switch between views using the view toggle:
1. Click the view toggle button above the table, on the right-hand side
2. Your preferred view is automatically saved for each section

### Showing and hiding columns {#showing-hiding-columns}
You can customise the appearance of the table on each page by showing or hiding columns.

1. Click the 'Columns' button
2. Select which columns to display
3. Settings are saved automatically

### Adding Test Tile Tracker to your mobile device {#mobile-home-screen}
